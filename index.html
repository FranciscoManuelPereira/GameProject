      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, there were two little sisters, Red Riding Hood and
        Yellow Riding Hood, who lived in a forest. On the other side of that
        forest lived their grandma, whose affection the two sisters rabidly
        competed for. On grandma’s birthday, whoever got to her house with their
        baskets full of gifts would definitely win grandma’s affection forever
        after. But we all know how fierce siblings’ competition can be…
      </p>
      <p>
        You can choose from <span id="red">Red Riding Hood</span> or a
        <span id="yellow">Yellow Riding Hood</span>. To win: you must be the
        first one to reach grandma’s house OR tap into your inner wolf and
        devour your sister!
